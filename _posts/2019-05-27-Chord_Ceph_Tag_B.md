## Testing Chord_Ceph_Tag_B with a random samples from the big project. Pag # 29.

For the master mix:

1. 0.5 µl of each primer (F and R) = 8.5 µl each
2. 12.5 µl of Biomix = Total of 212.5 µl
3. 8 µl nuclease free water, until you reach 25 ul total reaction
4. 1.5 µl of DNA template (15 ng/ml); depending of the DNA concentration of the Sample
5. 25 µl total reaction
6. 11.5 µl of master mix was pipetted in the strip tube
7. I tested 14 samples and 2 negative 
8. 52 C using CHO52long program

### Gel: 1% gel was run with GelGreen for 1.5 hours at 110V

### The samples doesn't amplified well in this PCR. Some of them with double bands.
