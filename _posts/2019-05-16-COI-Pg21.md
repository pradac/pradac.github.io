# Testing COI_with_R2. Pag # 21.

For the master mix:

1. 1 µl of each primer (F and R) = 9 µl each
2. 12.5 µl of Biomix = Total of 112.5 µl
3. 9.2 to 10 µl nuclease free water, until you reach 25 ul total reaction
4. From 0.5 to 1.3 of DNA template (30ng/ml); depending of the DNA concentration of the Sample
5. 25 µl total reaction
6. 23.7 to 24.5 µl of master mix was pipetted in the strip tube
7. I tested 7 samples and 1 negative for followings DNA concentration: 15ug/ul; 30 ug/ul; 40 ug/ul; 30ug/ul + old samples;
8. COI long program was use
