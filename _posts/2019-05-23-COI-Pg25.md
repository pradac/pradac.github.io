# Testing COI_with_R2 with two different types of DNA extraction kits (Quiagen and Zymo). Pag # 25.

For the master mix:

1. 0.7 µl of each primer (F and R) = 9 µl each
2. 12.5 µl of Biomix = Total of 112.5 µl
3. 7.1 to 10.1 µl nuclease free water, until you reach 25 ul total reaction
4. From 1 to 4 of DNA template (30ng/ml); depending of the DNA concentration of the Sample
5. 25 µl total reaction
6. I tested 14 samples and 2 negatives

# Gel 1 a 1% gel was run with GelGreen for 1.5 hours at 110V

# This PCR shows contamination in the negative
