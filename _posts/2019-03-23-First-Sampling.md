Went sampling with Cassie Raker.  
Left the lab at 8:00am and was back at ~12:00pm.  
All samples were taken in new sterile whirl paks.  
Filtering began once we got back. Samples that weren't being worked with were kept in the cold room to minimize degradation.  
Filtering followed [previous](https://github.com/meschedl/Narragansett_Bay_eDNA/blob/master/notebook/Test-Filter-and-Extraction.md) [protocols](https://github.com/meschedl/Narragansett_Bay_eDNA/blob/master/notebook/2019-03-19-Test-Sampling-Extractions.md)  
Filters were then stored in the -80
