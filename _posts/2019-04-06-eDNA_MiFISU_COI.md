**Testing MiFish-U at 65 C degree program**. Pag # 1.

For the master mix:
- 0.7 µl of each primer (F and R) = **11.9 µl each**
- 6 µl of Hot Stated Ready Mix (Kapa) = **102 µl**
- 4.1 µl nuclease free water = **69.7 µl**
- **1 or 2 µl of DNA template**; depending of the DNA concentration of the Sample: see the table; until reach aprox. 15 ng/μl
- **12.5 µl total reaction**
  - 11.5 µl of master mix was pipetted in the strip tube

I tested 14 samples and 2 negatives

**Gel # 1**
a 1% gel was run with GelGreen for 1 hour at 110V

![gel]({{site.baseurl}}/images/April_3_MFU_65_Gel1.png)

Only the GSO-1 worked for the GSO samples. Its probable that I use DNA template in excess (1 µl)
for the IPT samples.

**Gel # 2**

![gel]({{site.baseurl}}/images/April3_MFU_65_Gel2.png)

Only the GSO-2 doesn't worked for the GSO samples and K1 works very well but with the presence os two bands.

- No signs of contamination in the negatives.

**Testing COI; using COI program**. Pag # 3.

For the master mix:
- 1 µl of each primer (F and R) = **17 µl each**
- 12 µl of qiagen Mix = **212.5 µl**
- 9 µl nuclease free water = **153 µl**
- **1.5 µl of DNA template**
- **25 µl total reaction**
  - 23.5 µl of master mix was pipetted in the strip tube

I tested 14 samples and 2 negatives

**Gel # 1**
a 1% gel was run with GelGreen for 50 min at 110V

![gel]({{site.baseurl}}/images/April3_COI_Gel1.png)

None of the samples from IPT and GSO amplified. I put DNA template in excess (1.5 µl)

**Gel # 2**
a 1% gel was run with GelGreen for 50 min at 110V

![gel]({{site.baseurl}}/images/April3_COI_Gel2.png)

None of the samples from GSO amplified, but K1 sample worked well.

- No signs of contamination in the negatives.

**Testing MiFish-U at 65 C degree program**. Pag # 4.

For the master mix:
- 0.7 µl of each primer (F and R) = **11.9 µl each**
- 6 µl of Hot Stated Ready Mix (Kapa) = **102 µl**
- 4.6 µl nuclease free water = **78.2 µl**
- **0.5; 1; 1.2; 1.5; 2 µl of DNA template**; depending of the DNA concentration of the Sample: see the table; until reach aprox. 15 ng/μl
- **12.5 µl total reaction**
  - 10-11.5 µl of master mix was pipetted in the strip tube

I tested 14 samples and 2 negatives

**Gel # 1**
a 1% gel was run with GelGreen for 50 min at 110V

![gel]({{site.baseurl}}/images/April6_MiFishU_65C.png)

IPT-3; IPT-6; IPT-5 samples doesn't worked. The rest of the samples (11) works well, but with the presence of a double bands.
