# Testing COI_with_R2 with BSA+MgCl; only MgCl; only BSA. Pag # 27.

For the master mix:

1. 0.5 µl of each primer (F and R)
2. 12.5 µl of Biomix
3. 7 to 9 µl nuclease free water, until you reach 25 ul total reaction
4. From 2.5 DNA template
5. 25 µl total reaction
6. I tested 21 samples and 3 negatives
7. I added 2 ul of MgCL
8. I added 1 ul of BSA

# Gel 1 a 1% gel was run with GelGreen for 1.5 hours at 110V

# This PCR shows that all samples amplified well working with (BSA + MgCl); all the salmples also amplified well using only BSA. But, working only with MgCl  half of the samples amplified.
