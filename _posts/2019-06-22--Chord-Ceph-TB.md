## Testing Chord_Ceph_Tag_B with a random samples from the big project. Pag # 45.

For the master mix:

1. 0.3 µl of each primer (F and R) = 2.7 µl each
2. 5 µl of HotStart Pol = Total of 45 µl
3. 2 µl nuclease free water, until you reach 10 ul total reaction
4. 1.5 µl of DNA template (15 ng/ml); depending of the DNA concentration of the Sample
5. 10 µl total reaction
6. 8.5 µl of master mix was pipetted in the strip tube
7. 1 µl of BSA
7. I tested 7 samples and 1 negative
8. 52 C using CHO52long program

### Gel: 1% gel was run with GelGreen for 1.5 hours at 110V

### The samples doesn't amplified well in this PCR.
