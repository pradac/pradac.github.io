# Testing COI_with_R2. Pag # 28.

For the master mix:

1. 0.5 µl of each primer (F and R)
2. 12.5 µl of Biomix
3. 8 µl nuclease free water, until you reach 25 ul total reaction
4. 1.5 DNA template, the first 8 samples with 15ug/ul
5. 25 µl total reaction
6. I tested 21 samples and 3 negatives
7. I added 1 ul of BSA

# Gel 1 a 1% gel was run with GelGreen for 1.5 hours at 110V

## This PCR shows that all the samples amplified well with (15ug/ul) of DNA.
