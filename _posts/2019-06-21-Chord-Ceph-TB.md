## Testing Chord_Ceph_Tag_B with a NB sampling points from the small project. Pag # 39.

For the master mix:

1. 0.3 µl of each primer (F and R) = 2.7 µl each
2. 5 µl of HotStart Pol = Total of 45 µl
3. 0.4 µl nuclease free water, until you reach 10 ul total reaction
4. 4 µl of DNA template (15 ng/ml); depending of the DNA concentration of the Sample
5. 10 µl total reaction
6. 6 µl of master mix was pipetted in the strip tube
7. I tested 7 samples and 1 negative 
8. 52 C using CHO52long program
